## StatefulWidget lifecycle
- initState(): executed by Flutter when the StatefulWidget's state object is initialized
- build(): executed by Flutter when the Widget is built for the first time and after setState() was called
- dispose(): executed by Flutter right before the Widget will be deleted (e.x it was displayed conditionally)
